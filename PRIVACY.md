# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to the privacy policy of CreepedIn. This policy aims to inform you about how we handle your personal information when you use our extension.

## Collection and Use of Information

Our extension does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information. The extension operates strictly within your local browser to transform full names from the LinkedIn website into username formats (e.g., firstname.lastname). All data transformation takes place locally on your device and is not shared with any server or third party.

## Security

Since we neither collect nor store your personal information, there is no risk of loss or unauthorized access to such information through our extension. However, as the extension operates in your browser, it's important to ensure that your browser environment is secure to protect your information during general internet usage.

## Third Parties

Our extension does not share information with third parties, nor does it collect information for that purpose.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes to this policy will become effective immediately upon being posted on the privacy policy page.
