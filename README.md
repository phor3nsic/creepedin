## ##

`CreepedIn` is a simple chrome extension for full name extraction and conversion to emails/usernames. Utilizes the 'people' tab of the target company on LinkedIn.

## Installation ##

- Clone this repository to a folder of your choice
- Type "chrome://extensions" into the URL
- Turn on Developer Mode
- Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned

## How it works ##

`Creepedin` works by reading updates from the correct divs on LinkedIn's 'People' page. Navigate to the company page of your choice and scroll down until all employees are displayed. The list will populate automatically. (If it doesn't start populating, refresh the page).
